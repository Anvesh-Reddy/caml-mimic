want to save admission id's used to split
need to just redo data processing from the beginning
    like, including the sql stuff cause none of the files have admission ID


one day I'll memorize the order...
OLD:
get_notes -> group_and_sort -> split_data, filter_patients_and_labels -> split_labels, build_vocab, concat_notes_labels
    -> vocab_select -> longest_note, sort_by_length

NEW:
get_notes -> group_and_sort -> filter_patients_and_labels -> concat_and_split -> build_vocab -> vocab_select -> stitch_notes 
    -> sort_by_length

ATTN MODEL:
get_notes -> group_and_sort -> filter_patients_and_labels -> concat_and_split -> build_vocab -> vocab_select
    -> script that gets # notes per admission and also sorts by that

T+1:
output of stitch_notes (stitched, subject-time-sorted) -> build_future_data
    - redo vocab stuff? just using vocab from before... meh

TODO 
    think more about file names... 
    Ideally, I want to just keep:
        NOTEEVENTS.csv ("raw")
        notes_Y.csv ("processed")
        vocab and label files, obviously
        notes_Y_split.csv ("train/dev/test") data ready for models
        whatever other files are needed by any generators I write
            notes_Y_split_num_notes.csv
    basically, I should jst remove eerything that isn't that
    notes_Y_split.csv is assumed to be:
        - full vocabulary
        - consists of notes for a patient-admission, concatenated together
        - sorted length order
