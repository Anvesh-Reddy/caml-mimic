How to iterate... generator returns list of lists? [[note1, note2, ..., notek], [note1, note2, ..., notek], ..., ]]
Then, pass each note set through word lstm individually because you have to
    this creates sequence of k doc vectors for each note set
    can then batch those together and send them through doc lstm
could batch notes by length and keep track of which belongs to which admission somehow? would also need position, sounds hard
Issue with doing conv -> lstm attn is that we would lose info on what came from where b/c pooling. w/o pooling, can't have 
    fixed size query vec. Look into this, how does CV do attention?
    see "show attend and tell". I think I could do it (lstm over conv output, no pooling) but the output is not fixed size
    Kind of annoying how limiting things like being able to batch are!
    could look into it more later
